	 LSS Models fitted via Model-based Boosting

Call:
gamboostLSS(formula = y ~ ., data = dat, families = NBinomialLSS(),     control = boost_control(mstop = 1))

Number of boosting iterations: mstop = 10 10 
Step size:  0.1 

Families:

	 Negative Negative-Binomial Likelihood: mu (log link) 

Loss function: -(lgamma(y + sigma) - lgamma(sigma) - lgamma(y + 1) + sigma *  
     log(sigma) + y * f - (y + sigma) * log(exp(f) + sigma)) 
 

	 Negative Negative-Binomial Likelihood: sigma (log link) 

Loss function: -(lgamma(y + exp(f)) - lgamma(exp(f)) - lgamma(y + 1) + exp(f) *  
     f + y * log(mu) - (y + exp(f)) * log(mu + exp(f)))
